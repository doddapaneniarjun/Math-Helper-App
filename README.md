Math Helper App (Made In 2025)
The Math Helper App is a lightweight, browser-based study tool designed to help students practice topics from books like Singapore Math, AoPS, and Khan Academy. The app organizes content into books, lessons, and practice problems so that users can explore math step by step. It runs entirely in the browser, meaning no server setup is needed, and it works offline once loaded.

When you open the app, you will see two main tabs at the top: Topics and Books. The Topics tab gives a quick overview of lessons across all books in one place, while the Books tab lets you browse through each book individually. By clicking on a book, you can view all of its lessons, and then select a lesson to read a short summary and access practice problems.

Each lesson contains practice problems. When you click on a problem, it opens in a pop-up modal. Inside the modal, you can type your answer into the input box and either press the Enter key or click the Check Answer button to see if you are correct. The app will immediately give you feedback: a green “Correct!” if your answer matches, or a red message showing the correct solution if it doesn’t.

The app automatically saves your progress using your browser’s local storage. This means you don’t need to create an account or log in—your progress is saved locally on your device. When you come back later, the app remembers which problems you attempted and whether you got them right or wrong. This allows you to keep improving without starting over.

Since the app is a static website, it can be deployed for free on platforms like Vercel. After deployment, you will get a live URL that you can share with classmates or teachers. To use the app, simply visit the URL in any modern web browser. The app is mobile-friendly, so it works on phones, tablets, and computers. With regular use, the Math Helper App becomes a personal practice space to build confidence and mastery in math.
